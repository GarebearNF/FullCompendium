# FullCompendium
This module contains compendium packs with all paid content from D&D Beyond. Currently contains creatures, mundane items, magical items, and spells.

## Updates
As there were significant updates to compendium structures, this package is deprecated for use in FoundryVTT V11 and is replaced by my [Shared Compendium|https://github.com/GarebearNF/shared-compendium/tree/main] module.
